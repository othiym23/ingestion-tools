management console:
* manage pending content:
** cache pending album list in holding database
** write periodic task to rebuild pending album cache
** write periodic task to connect to MusicBrainz and try to match unmatched tracks
** group tracks by artist directory + album name
* validate number of tracks in set vs number of tracks loaded
* add random album processing
* flag unmarked compilations (correction already handled)
* flag presence of ID3v1 tag (deletion already handled)
* prompt to compare two albums
* prompt to replace and / or remove one of the two albums
* load list of genres from database and canonicalize if not direct match
* match artists against existing archive
* match artists against Netjuke

album ingestion:
* split consolidated multi-disc albums back into their discs
* fetch Musicbrainz annotations from server
* classical support:
** add reading and writing of ID3v2 fields related to orchestral and
   ensemble music (composer, conductor, soloists, ensembles)
** ensure that genre matches contents

heuristic metadata correction:
* collect comments and turn into encoder when a fraction are missing
* correctly handle split albums with "Artist 1 / Artist 2" titles
* improve encoder cattle-catcher to do something different with 
  release codes (i.e. not sticking them on the encoder string)
* handle "pretty" display of featured artist list

code quality:
* document all heuristics used in code base
* collect and / or remedy all inline TODOS
* improve overall code coverage to over 95%
