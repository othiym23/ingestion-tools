management console:
* manage pending content:
** cache pending album list in holding database
** write periodic task to rebuild pending album cache
** write periodic task to connect to MusicBrainz and try to match unmatched tracks
* add random album processing
* prompt to compare two albums
* prompt to replace and / or remove one of the two albums
* load list of genres from database and canonicalize if not direct match
* match artists against existing archive
* match artists against Netjuke
* canonicalize track genres against Netjuke genre list
* associate arbitrary image with track
* support the cobbling-together of new albums from old albums (e.g. making
  Wire's "Behind the Curtain" out of bonus tracks on Japanese releases of
  the first three albums)

album ingestion:
* split consolidated multi-disc albums back into their discs
* fetch Musicbrainz annotations from server
* support album versions
* support album subtitles
* classical support:
** add reading and writing of ID3v2 fields related to orchestral and
   ensemble music (composer, conductor, soloists, ensembles)
** ensure that genre matches contents

heuristic metadata correction:
* collect comments and turn into encoder when a fraction are missing
* correctly handle split albums with "Artist 1 / Artist 2" titles
* improve encoder cattle-catcher to do something different with 
  release codes (i.e. not sticking them on the encoder string)
* handle "pretty" canonicalization of featured artist list

audio file validation / QA:
* build a fa√ßade over existing ingestion framework that's observable by
  the validation framework
* create validation checkers from criteria:
** path not in artist/album/track format
** path doesn't match metadata
** path name isn't in canonical form
** filename doesn't match metadata
** filename isn't in canonical form
** track contains APE tag
** track has ID3v1 tag
** track has ID3v2.2 tag
** track has ID3v2.3 tag (less severe)
** ID3v1 and ID3v2 metadata don't match
** track LAME header is missing
** track LAME version is not 3.93.1 or 3.96
** track is not VBR encoded OR track is CBR and encoded at less than 256kbps
** track LAME method used was not --preset standard or --alt-preset standard
** track has duplicate ID3v2 frames
** track has multiple conflicting frames for same (singular) attribute
** names are improperly capitalized
** track has non-handled standard frames
** track has nonstandard frames
** track has nonstandard, non-Apple frames
** album is missing tracks (tracks loaded vs tracks on album discrepancy)
** release is a compilation but not marked as such
** track metadata is not canonicalized / populated according to ingestion
   system standards
** track is lacking MusicBrainz metadata

code quality:
* document all heuristics used in code base
* collect and / or remedy all inline TODOS
* improve overall code coverage to over 95%
